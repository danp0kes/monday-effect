# How the Stock Market Reacts to the Weekend 

## Theory

### The Monday Effect

The Monday effect theory suggests that a stock on a day following the weekend will continue to trend in the direction that was set before the weekend. For instance, if a stock on Friday is trending upwards, the stock on Monday will also trend upwards.

### The Weekend Effect

The Weekend Effect suggests that stock returns are higher on days directly before the weekend than days directly after. For instance, the difference between the opening and closing price on a Friday results in gains that are bigger than gains found between the opening and closing prices on the following Monday. This theory will be tested and its extent measured to find potential anomalies in the market. Gains on other weekdays will also be monitored to determine which day results in the best profits.

## Key Questions

Do trends continue past the weekend? Are Friday and Monday returns significantly correlated? How does this correlation compare to other days? How does this vary over time? Does the current trend influence the trend of the next period?

## Process

Both the Weekend and Monday effect will be tested using data from the S&P 500, an index fund with a long history of data. A dataframe will be consolidated to calculate returns. Data will be selected, cut, and merged to compare days and their respective open and close prices. Weekend data is created to compare Friday's accompanying Monday data. Only then can trends be added.

## Key Takeaways

### The Weekend Effect

Higher frequencies of high Friday returns result in a positive gain. However, investing on Monday in a year with a lower frequency of high Friday returns offers a greater gain. Years where Friday returns are less frequent than Monday returns could be correlated to economic turmoil as seen in 2020, 2008 and the early 2000s. Investing on Mondayâ€™s during these years would see significant gains. Timing the market is important to the Weekend Effect.

### Monday Effect

The data supports a stronger relationship between Monday and Tuesday. Tuesday returns that follow a negative Monday average a positive 16 basis points with a general correlation of -.21. Tracking this over the years, 2020 showed a linear negative correlation of 66%. Monday return prices in a year like 2020 could lead to significant insights into how the price on Tuesday would react. More analysis into why this happened is required.
